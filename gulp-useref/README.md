# treehouse-gulp-course
Code for my Treehouse Gulp.js course!  June, 2015.

**Note:** The "dist" folder is ignored in the .gitignore file.  Often it is a convention to not check in the "dist" folder or other files that are built for production.  These files are either built locally on a developers machine and then pushed to a production server, or they are built on a staging server.  In any case, usually "dist" won't get checked into github.
